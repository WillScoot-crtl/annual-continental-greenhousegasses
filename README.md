This project displays the annual CO₂ emissions from the past 29 years for each continent. My primary goal was to incorporate data cleaning and visualization, and I seperated this through user interaction.
The origional csv file used will be attached along with the code, however, I found it on the open sourced website, Our World in Data, "CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions" under the data explorer tab.
To effectively add data visualization and cleaning, I used the libraries pandas, plotlyexpress, and os modual. Like pandas, the syntax that plotlyexpress issues is complex, so I decided to only stick with basic interactive visualizations.
Importing the os modual was a cleaning choice to display the data into excel, and since the origional file wasn't in xslx, I needed to change that. lastly, I built classes for practice as well as keeping the code clean. 

This project is only an initial draft. I'd want to allow more access to the data for the user, expanding beyond the continents, and build algorithms in order to relay the data efficiently (binary seach).
I'd likely continue with plotlyexpress too since its latest version supports well with pandas', and I only scratched the serface of the documentation.
